## Hi there 👋

### I am Ben, I develop and abandon personal projects 🤷‍♂️
- 💡 At the moment, I'm learning Go, Rust, and Svelte(kit).
- 🔍 Looking for a job, backend(Go or Typescript) entry level position.
- 🚧 A stackoverflowy-kindof-website, under development, not feature complete yet 'cause no 💸. [Try it here](https://algory.pages.dev/).
- 🚧 A website like ngl.link/secretm.me, the design is bad but it works lmao. I don't even have time to refactor the backend, so why would I re-design the frontend, jk? [Try it here](https://confessit.vercel.app/).
- 🧰 I made my own ```tree``` cli tool, it is used to display directories. [Try it here](https://github.com/mystique09/lls-clap).
