## üëã Hi there

Hi, I'm Benjie. I'm a self-taught developer from Cebu, 
currently working on a startup company as a Junior Front-end Web Developer.
I enjoy working on a variety of projects including web development, and programming in languages
like Sveltekit, Javascript/Typescript, Go, and Rust.
I like to language-hop alot because I like exploring new paradigms, ideas, and design patterns.
