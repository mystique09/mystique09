## üëã Hi there

Hi, I'm Benjie. I'm a self-taught developer from Cebu, 
I enjoy working on a variety of projects including Front-end development,
Back-end development, and programming in languages like Sveltekit, Javascript/Typescript, Go, and Rust.
I also like to language-hop alot because I like exploring new paradigms, ideas, and design patterns.
