## Hey, I'm Benjie Ben

I am a self-taught programmer. I'm from Philippines.

I started coding way back in 2019. I really wanted to become a professional programmer at that time. I started with Lua and Javascript, but I focused more on Javascript because of Web development. Designing and coding challenges are my happiness. ðŸ˜Š
