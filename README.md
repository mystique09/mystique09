## Hi there 👋

## I am Ben, I develop random stuff ::<>

### About Me
- Self-taught developer from Cebu.
- 💡 Go, Sveltekit, Javasript, and Rust.
- 🔍 Looking for a job, backend(Go or Typescript) entry or junior position.

### Projects
- 🔗 A stackoverflowy-kindof-website, under development, not feature complete yet 'cause no 💸. [Try it here](https://algory.pages.dev/)
- 🚧 LMS website, a google classroom clone. [Under development](https://class-management.vercel.app/)
- 🚧 Anonymous confession website, the design is bad but it works lmao. I don't even have time to refactor the backend, so why would I re-design the frontend? Just kidding mate. [Try it here](https://confessit.vercel.app/)
- 🧰 I made my own ```tree``` cli tool, it is used to display directories. [Try it here](https://github.com/mystique09/lls-clap)
