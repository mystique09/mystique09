## üëã Hi there


Hi, I'm Ben and I'm a self-taught developer from Cebu. I enjoy working on a variety of projects, including web development and programming in languages like Sveltekit, Javascript, Typescript, Go, and Rust.

:construction: Current Projects
- Honing my web development skills.
- Building a stackoverflow-style website (currently under development).
- Developing a LMS website (a google classroom clone).
- Creating an anonymous confession website (the design is still a work in progress).
- Developing my own tree CLI tool for displaying directories.
